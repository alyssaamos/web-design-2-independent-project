    <h3>How to spot pest damage on your plants</h3>
    <p>Spotting pest damage on your plants can be tricky. Sometimes by the time you notice the extent of the damage, its too late to save your plant. We are going to share some tips and signs to catch the pests early.
    The best way to keep pests off your plant is prevention so when you get a new plant, clean them and quarantine them for two weeks before you put them with your other plants. Another way to catch pests early is to
    check your plants atleast once a month and clean the leaves off with an insecticide or a diluted neem oil mixture. Poke in the soil to prevent soil from compacting and water your plant with 1 part hydrogen peroxide
    and 3 parts water, this will help to kill pest eggs in the soil, and direct oxygen to the roots of your plant. Even if you don't have pests on your plants, this routine will help keep your plants healthy and their leaves shiny!</p>
